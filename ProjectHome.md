# The goal #

A digital D&D table to make the D&D rule set more accessible for (very) casual players.

# Secondary goals #

  * Hands-on experience with some interesting tech & design problems
    * Unity
    * Mobile device connectivity: Photon socket server, Photon Turnbased
    * Modeling complex turn based rule systems
    * Touch interfaces
    * Augmented reality (Vuforia)
  * Having fun

# Motivation #

The D&D rule set can get very complex, especially when you have casual players who care more about having fun (and having a drink), then the actual game.

As a DM, I would love to have a tool to automate as many common tasks & checks as possible, without taking the ultimate control out of the hands of the DM. The DM should be able to overrule any automated action, and change the ongoing game to his liking.
